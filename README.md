<h1 align="center">Snipcart for Craft CMS</h1>

Quickly turn a Craft CMS website into a fully functioning store.

- Fast store setup (even if you're new to Snipcart) with an optional Field Type and Twig tags.
- Control panel section for sales stats and browsing orders, customers, subscriptions, and abandoned carts without leaving Craft.
- Create discounts and issue refunds from the control panel.
- Live shipping rates and tax calculation at checkout with Snipcart's various shipping and tax providers.
- ShipStation integration for fetching shipping rates and forwarding completed Snipcart orders for processing.

If Commerce Pro is too complex for your project and Commerce Lite is too limiting, Snipcart will be a great fit.
